A tutorial for getting rewrite rules (MyBB SEF style) work with nginx:

The same method can be applied for Google SEO rewrite rules, but you 
have to create those rules manually. Google SEO can not detect that 
you are not using Apache, and will only generate .htaccess rules.

Here is an example of what nginx rules for Google SEO look like:

  # Google SEO workaround for search.php highlights:
  # Make this rule the first rewrite rule in your .htaccess!
  rewrite ^/MyBB/([^&]*)&(.*)$ http://yoursite/MyBB/$1?$2 permanent;

  # Google SEO Sitemap:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)sitemap-([^./]+)\.xml)$ /MyBB/misc.php?google_seo_sitemap=$2 last;

  # Google SEO URL Forums:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)Forum-([^./]+))$ /MyBB/forumdisplay.php?google_seo_forum=$2 last;

  # Google SEO URL Threads:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)Thread-([^./]+))$ /MyBB/showthread.php?google_seo_thread=$2 last;

  # Google SEO URL Announcements:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)Announcement-([^./]+))$ /MyBB/announcements.php?google_seo_announcement=$2 last;

  # Google SEO URL Users:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)User-([^./]+))$ /MyBB/member.php?action=profile&google_seo_user=$2 last;

  # Google SEO URL Calendars:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)Calendar-([^./]+))$ /MyBB/calendar.php?google_seo_calendar=$2 last;

  # Google SEO URL Events:
  rewrite ^/MyBB/((?i)Event-([^./]+))$ /MyBB/calendar.php?action=event&google_seo_event=$2 last;
  
  # In the event the server is using both NGINX and Apache,
  # the URLs should have `rewritten` set to `1`.
  
  # Sets rewritten so that when the rewritten URL is proxied to Apache,
  # the plugin won't try to redirect the user (causing an infinite loop,
  # by redirecting to the SEO url, which is rewritten by NGINX and proxied to
  # Apache, then redirected, etc.)
  if ($is_args) {
      set $args "$args&rewritten=1";
  }
  
  # Proxy pass below
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8001$uri$is_args$args
